## Fluid Simulation (the part with the math)
This crate has all the logic for the FLIP algorithm.

I'd like to get this to some reasonable state in the future so it could be used in other projects, but there is a lot of work to do here.

For now the simulation really doesn't live up to what it should be capable of, there are no waves or splashes.

I'm working on it and would be thankful for any advice anyone can provide.
